   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>This document provides a mechanism for the specification of
     per-flow maximum bit rates.  Such values are used to limit
     individual IP flow (5 tuple) rates while maintaining a higher aggregate
     maximum bit rate across aggregate flows.</t>
     <t>It supplements the various values defined Aggregate Maximum
       Bitrates such as those specified for IP Mobility <xref target="RFC7222"/>.

<section title="Relationship to other Max Bit Rate settings" anchor="relationships">
<t>
    The per flow AVPs can be used with any other combination of AVPs
    representing multiple IP flows (5 tuples).
</t>
<t>
    For example, the Per-Flow-Max-DL-Bit-Rate can be used to limit the individual
    bit rate of any single IP flow while the aggregate rate of the IP flows
    can be limited by the Aggregate-Max-DL-Bit-Rate AVP <xref target="RFC7222"/>.
</t>
<t>
    For example, setting a Per-Flow-Max-DL-Bit-Rate of 2Mbps and
    an Aggregate-Max-DL-Bit-Rate of 20Mbps would permit up a mimimum
    of ten IP flows of 2Mbps.
</t>
<t>
    Achieving higher throughput is possible through the use of mulitple
    connections or paths.  However, no single IP flow will dominate
    amongst competing flows.
</t>
</section>
   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
<t>
   This document defines new AVPs to limit the maximum bitrate of an
   IP flow (5-tuple) in the mobile devices uplink or downlink. As
   these are further constraints on Diameter applications already
   specifying aggregeate maximum bit rates, they do not introduce
   new security concerns for an Authorized User.
</t>
<t>
   For an operator, access to this data may give some insight to how
   the associated service operates. It is RECOMMENDED that this or any
   Diameter communication is secured.
</t>
<t>
   The Security Considerations of the Diameter protocol itself have been
   discussed in RFC <xref target="RFC6733"/>.  Use of the AVPs defined in this
   document MUST take into consideration the security issues and
   requirements of the Diameter base protocol.
